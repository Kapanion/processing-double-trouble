## Todo
- [x] Optimize checking for collisions with the maze.
- [x] Fix weird behavior when the tanks collide (one tank has priority).
- [ ] Wall's collider is displayed even though the `display_debug` method is not called.
- [ ] In the `Maze` class, rows and columns should be inverted.

### Do these if there's enough time:
- [ ] If one tank pushes another one to a wall, the other tank will slightly overlap with the wall. Fix this.
